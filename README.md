This project is an implementation of [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) designed to run on the [Digilent Nexys 2](http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?Prod=NEXYS2) development board. The overall system is implemented in VHDL and a PicoBlaze soft processor core is used to implement the game logic. The game is controlled using a PS/2 keyboard and displayed on a VGA monitor.
